# SQL Project: Famous People
## Khanacademy / Relational Queries in SQL
### Summary
In this project, I am going to make my own table with some small set of “famous people”, then make more tables about things they do and join those to create nice human readable lists. I have chosen to work on a list of Billionaires.

*The following concept on joining databases were applied:*
inner join, self join and outer join.
